# Checkers

This code is simply an archive of an old attempt. Written in javascript, this program is supposed to simulate a simple checkers game between two players. The program runs in your browser using html and css. To create the checkers board, I used the js canvas. 

There are some significant bugs in this code which makes the game arguably unplayable. 

If you want to contact the programmer (me), you can email me at alejandrobreen@gmail.com.
